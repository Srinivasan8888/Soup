"""Can a shipped config attach a LoRA adapter at all? (#1116)

A config can parse through the schema, name a repo that resolves on the Hub, and
still be untrainable: ``target_modules: auto`` resolves to nothing for an
architecture neither Soup nor peft maps, and ``get_peft_model`` raises. Nothing
checked that until now --- ``validate-recipes`` (#330) parses YAML,
``check_recipe_repo_ids`` (#677) resolves repo ids, ``soup doctor --config``
(#903) reads a declared table, and ``soup adapters audit`` (#763) runs after
training. #1070 (every shipped MoE recipe), #798's dropout refusal and #1074's
``templates/moe.yaml`` blocker were each found by a person reading code.

The check builds the architecture on the **meta device** from ``config.json``
alone --- no weights, no download of a checkpoint, no GPU --- and then runs
Soup's own target resolution and the real ``get_peft_model``. The verdict is
therefore the trainer's verdict rather than a re-implementation of it.

Two disciplines carried over from #677, because without them a guard becomes
noise and gets muted:

**A failure to load the architecture is not a failure to attach.** A gated repo,
a repo needing ``trust_remote_code``, and a config this ``transformers`` cannot
read are all :data:`Verdict.UNVERIFIED` --- "could not check" --- never
:data:`Verdict.CANNOT_ATTACH`. Whether such a repo is missing is #677's
question, and answering it here in a second voice is how two guards disagree.

**Remote code is never executed.** ``trust_remote_code`` stays off, and a repo
that needs it reports as unverifiable. A preflight that runs arbitrary code from
the Hub to decide whether a recipe is healthy is a worse problem than the one it
solves.
