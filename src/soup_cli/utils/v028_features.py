"""v0.28.0 speed/memory feature application — extracted for multi-trainer reuse.

The original v0.28.0 release wired Cut Cross-Entropy, FP8, and kernel auto-compose
into ``SFTTrainerWrapper`` only and gated other trainers via a
``model_validator`` to fail-fast at config-load. v0.33.0 (#43) drops that
gate and extracts the apply logic here so any trainer wrapper can call it
in two lines.

Kernel auto-compose is now rejected at config load because it never applied
the candidate it reported. Activation-offloading is NOT included here — its
scope is the entire ``trainer.train()`` call (it wraps in a context manager),
so each trainer wires it inline. CCE / FP8 are pre-train one-shots and fit this
single helper.
